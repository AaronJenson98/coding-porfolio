Hello! I'm Aaron Jenson, a 25-year-old Junior Software Engineer located in Salt Lake City, UT. I am currently working on developing my experience in creating dynamic and creative websites. With a solid foundation in Computer Science and practical experience in Full-stack Web Development, I am deeply intrigued by the realms of technology, software innovation, and problem-solving.

My educational pursuits at University of Utah and App Academy's Full-stack Web Development program have provided me with a comprehensive grasp of modern web technologies and programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java, as well as a deep understanding of software development methodologies. Beyond academic pursuits, I enjoy Crossfit, skiing, spending time with my family and friends, and watching The Office.
