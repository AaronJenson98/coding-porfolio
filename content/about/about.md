Hello! I'm Aaron Jenson, a 25-year-old Junior Software Engineer located in Salt Lake City, UT, and currently contributing to the software landscape at various capacities. With a solid foundation in Computer Science and practical experience in Full-stack Web Development, I'm deeply intrigued by the realms of technology, software innovation, and problem-solving.

During my academic journey, I actively engaged in extracurricular pursuits to enrich my learning experience. Beyond academic pursuits, I embraced roles such as a QC Technologist II at BioFire Diagnostics, where I executed precise manual testing and contributed to the enhancement of quality standards. This role not only honed my technical skills but also fostered my ability to collaborate effectively within a dynamic team environment.

My involvement in diverse activities is highlighted by my time as an Assistant Store Manager at Calvin Klein, where I harnessed my organizational prowess to drive store operations. Similarly, my educational pursuits at Harvard University and App Academy's Full-stack Web Development program have provided me with a comprehensive grasp of modern web technologies, programming languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java, as well as a deep understanding of software development methodologies.

When not immersed in code, I indulge my interests in literature, music, and cinema. Just as I enjoy diving into code, I relish exploring the imaginative worlds crafted by fantasy and science fiction literature. These pursuits further enrich my ability to approach challenges with creativity and adaptability.
